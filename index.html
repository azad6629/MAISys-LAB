        <h2>Advancing Medical Image Analysis through AI</h2>
        <p>At MAISys, we focus on developing and applying artificial intelligence techniques to improve medical image analysis. Our work aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy, treatment planning, and patient care through innovative machine learning approaches.</p>
        
        <h3>Our Research Focus</h3>
        <p>Our research encompasses several key areas in medical AI. We are developing self-supervised learning techniques to leverage large volumes of unlabeled radiographs, aiming to improve diagnostic models with limited labeled data. In the field of radiogenomics, we are working on integrating multi-modal data, including medical images and electronic health records, to enhance cancer diagnosis and predict critical genomic mutations. Our work also extends to federated learning, addressing the challenges of data privacy and heterogeneity in medical imaging across institutions. We are exploring distributed learning techniques to enable collaborative model training while keeping patient data locally secured. Additionally, we are developing a semi-automatic standard echo image acquisition system, utilizing AI and robotics to assist in obtaining high-quality echocardiographic views, potentially reducing the physical strain on sonographers and improving image consistency.</p>

        <h3>Current Projects</h3>
